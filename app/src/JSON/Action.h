 * @class JSON::Action
 * @brief A class that represents an action which can send data to connected
 *        devices.
 *
 * The JSON::Action class allows users to create an action with an ID, and
 * manage associated metadata such as an icon, title, transmission data
 * (txData), and an end-of-line (eol) sequence. It also provides functionality
 * to serialize and deserialize the action to and from a QJsonObject, making it
 * suitable for JSON-based communication or storage.
