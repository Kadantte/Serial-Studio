/**
 * @brief The Frame class
 *
 * The frame class represents a complete frame, including the groups & datasets
 * that compose it. This class allows Serial Studio to build the user interface
 * dinamically from the received data.
 *
 * The process of building a frame and representing it in Serial Studio is:
 * 1) Physical device sends data
 * 2) I/O driver receives data
 * 3) I/O manager processes the data and separates the frames
 * 4) JSON generator creates a JSON file with the data contained in each frame.
 * 5) UI dashboard class receives the JSON file.
 * 6) TimerEvents class notifies the UI dashboard that the user interface should
 *    be re-generated.
 * 7) UI dashboard feeds JSON data to this class.
 * 8) This class creates a model of the JSON data with the values of the latest
 *    frame.
 * 9) UI dashboard updates the widgets with the C++ model provided by this
 * class.
